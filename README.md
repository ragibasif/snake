# Snake

A lightweight CLI utility that sanitizes file and directory names by replacing non-alphanumeric characters with underscores.

## How it works

- Every character that is not `a-z`, `A-Z`, or `0-9` is replaced with `_`
- Consecutive underscores are collapsed into one
- Leading and trailing underscores are removed
- If the resulting name is empty (e.g. the original name was all symbols), the file is renamed to a UTC timestamp
- Hidden files and directories (names starting with `.`) are skipped

## Requirements

Python 3.13+

## Installation

```bash
chmod +x snake.py
mv snake.py snake
cp snake /usr/local/bin/snake
```

## Usage

```
snake [-h] [-v] [-r] [-f FILE | -d DIR]
```

| Flag | Long form      | Description                                                   |
|------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-h` | `--help`       | Show help message and exit                                    |
| `-v` | `--verbose`    | Enable DEBUG-level logging                                    |
| `-r` | `--recursive`  | Recurse into subdirectories (not usable with `-f`)            |
| `-f` | `--file`       | Operate on a single file or directory (mutually exclusive with `-d`, `-r`) |
| `-d` | `--directory`  | Operate on a specific directory (mutually exclusive with `-f`) |

## Examples

```bash
# Sanitize only the current directory (non-recursive)
snake

# Sanitize the current directory and all subdirectories
snake --recursive

# Enable verbose output
snake --verbose

# Recursive with verbose output
snake --verbose --recursive

# Operate on a single file or directory
snake --file my\ file\ (1).txt

# Operate on a specific directory (non-recursive)
snake --directory path/to/dir

# Operate on a specific directory recursively
snake --recursive --directory path/to/dir
```
